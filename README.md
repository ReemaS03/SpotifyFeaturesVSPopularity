ideas:
* does gender affect gpa
* does gpa affect starting salary 
* does gender affect starting salary
* does field of study affect starting salary or gpa
* career satisfication compared to salary
* does salary affect work life balance

* how does gpa, number of internships, networking influence affect job offers and salaries (some regression)
* does university ranking affect job offers (Is it worth it to go to a top university?)
* likelihood that you get a job based on your stats (if you have a low gpa but high number of internships, what is your chances of getting a job?)
* are students with `high Networking_Score` and `Internships_Completed` more likely to become entrepreneurs? 


* linear regression on starting salary
* linear regression on `Career_Satisfaction`
* logistic regression on job offer, whether you get the job or not
* predict years to promotion
* correlation analysis to determine which features are most influential to career success (`Starting_Salary`, `Job_Offers`, `Years_to_Promotion`, `Career_Satisfaction`)
* compare `Starting_Salary` and `Job_Offers` across the different `Fields_of_Study` to see what majors lead to better career outcomes through t-test/ANOVA
* summary statistics of `High_School_GPA`, `SAT_Score`, `University_GPA`, and `Job_Offers`
* analyze salary differences by university ranking, field of study, and internships through visualizations
* analyze trends in Years_to_Promotion across different career levels through time series

* since job offers is discrete, we can perform logistic regression. We can categorize the job offers as in 0 means no job offers, 1-4 means low job offers and 5+ could be high amount of job offers. We can perform logistic regression and see what features output to no job offers, low or high job offers.



Ideas:
* logistic regression less than 50 is not popular  0 and more than 50 is popular 1
* train logistic model, split test train model, what is our accuracy 
* 80 20 auc roc confusion matrix
* classification

* hypothesis test
* parametric and nonparametric tests

* svm, pca maybe

* tests for completeness

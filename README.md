ideas:
* what are the distributions of key audio features (danceability, energy, valence, tempo, loudness, etc.)?
* how are danceability and energy related?
* do different genres have distinct distributions of valence and danceability?
* which genres tend to have the highest and lowest popularity?
* are some genres more energetic or danceable than others?
* what is the most common key for songs?
* are major key songs more popular than minor key songs?
* does valence differ significantly between major and minor key songs?
* do explicit songs tend to be more or less popular?
* which genres have the most explicit songs?
* can we cluster songs based on audio features?
* are danceable songs more popular on average?
* does instrumentalness affect popularity?
* does loudness differ significantly between explicit and non-explicit songs?
* do different time signatures have significantly different valence scores?
* which features have the highest correlation with popularity?
* what are the most important features for predicting popularity?


Ideas:
* logistic regression less than 50 is not popular  0 and more than 50 is popular 1
* train logistic model, split test train model, what is our accuracy 
* 80 20 auc roc confusion matrix
* classification

* hypothesis test
* parametric and nonparametric tests

* svm, pca

* tests for completeness
